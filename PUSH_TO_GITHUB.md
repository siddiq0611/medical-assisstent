# ðŸš€ Push Medical Assistant to GitHub

## Quick Setup Commands

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "+" â†’ "New repository"
3. Name: `medical-assistant`
4. Description: `AI-powered medical assistant with GPT-4o chat`
5. Keep it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
Copy and run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```bash
# Ensure we're in the right directory
cd "E:\NewProjects\medical_assisstent"

# Add all files and commit if needed
git add .
git commit -m "Complete medical assistant with AI chat features"

# Create the "Chatbit added" branch
git checkout -b "Chatbit-added"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-assistant.git

# Push main branch
git checkout master
git push -u origin master

# Push the feature branch
git checkout "Chatbit-added"
git push -u origin "Chatbit-added"
```

### Step 3: Verify
- Go to your GitHub repository
- You should see both `master` and `Chatbit-added` branches
- All files should be uploaded

## Alternative: One-Command Setup

If you prefer, here's a single command sequence:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Medical assistant with AI chat" && git checkout -b "Chatbit-added" && git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-assistant.git && git push -u origin master && git push -u origin "Chatbit-added"
